PRESENCE OF GLUTEN IN WHITE DISTILLED VINEGAR
Since gluten is one of the proteins in wheat and other grains and is left behind when starch is converted to sugar, there is a possibility that vinegar made from non-distilled grain-sourced alcohol might contain gluten.  However, as any grain-sourced alcohol used by Laboratory, Inc for making white distilled vinegar is triple-distilled, to the best of our knowledge, no gluten is present.

I have some vintage fur stoles and collars with silk linings that need a good cleaning. I read on your blog that this can be done with Delicate Wash. However, Google articles claim that hand washing furs and immersing them in water will result in considerable shrinkage and will ruin the fur. Is this as safe as you say?","Dear Brianna-
Thank you for reaching out. While we do not specialize in fur, we have tried and had some successes. We cannot guarantee that the below methods will work best for you, however. We ususally consult fur industry veteran Tom Moriber! I've provided a link to his site for you below.  http://www.fureverfurs.com/v2/

We successfully wash fur trims and furs that are in a knitted form with Wool & Cashmere Shampoo. Saturating fur that is on the skin is a problem because the skin can shrink and/or become dry and brittle. Vintage fur is generally dry from age and climate as well as brittle and stinky.

Industrial fur cleaning is essentially putting the fur in a tumbler with a chemical and saw dust.  Our DYI approach would be to sprinkle with cornstarch or powder, sit, and shake out well. A silicone-based, fur glaze is recommended for older furs to condition them. We use our Crease Release to spray and conditioner our furs. We also use our Fabric Fresh which is gentle and safe enough to use on fur while not damaging or drying the fur.

I would first try and treat the yellow with the Wash & Stain Bar. Follow by hand washing with Delicate Wash and cold water. Since the dress is vintage, it will require multiple washings, rinsings, and soakings.

Our All-Purpose Bleach Alternative is the BEST for yellowing and dinginess, but not ideal for silk. If necesary, you could do an extremely quick soak in it. Just be mindful that it may damage the fibers if subjected to the bleach alternative for an extended amount of time.

I have some delicate vintage table linens that have developed some brownish tea-looking spots while stored. The linens were clean and pressed and over the last couple of years these spots have surfaced. Is it safe to attempt to bleach them?","Dear Barbara-
We never recommend using chlorine bleach to launder your items, as the harsh chemicals can be damaging to fabrics. My best recommendation to remove these stains would be to apply our Stain Solution directly to the stained areas. You can then make a bath with warm water and our All-Purpose Bleach Blternative and allow the linens to soak for 30 minutes. 

Depending on the severity of the stains you may need to repeat the pre-treating and soaking process- to kick it up a notch you can sprinkle the bleach alternative directly to the stain and gently work this “paste” into the stained area. Once you are satisfied with the stain removal you can then launder as normal. I've linked below additional instruction on removing stains and also an instructional blog on cleaning heirloom linens.

pants. Somehow they have yellowed in patches. Is there any hope?  ","Dear Camrin,
You can treat the yellowing with Stain Solution, gently working it into the fabric with a stain brush.  Next, make a bath with tepid water and Wool & Cashmere Shampoo and allow the pants to soak for 30 minutes.  Rinse well under cold water and press the water out, do not wring or twist.  Do not use the dryer, lay the pants flat to dry. Steaming while damp is best to reduce creasing.  

To avoid yellowing on fabrics, its best to launder prior to storage, removing all body oils, perfumes, and even starch as this can cause fabric to discolor. You can also reference our Stain Removal recipe and Washing Wool & Cashmere recipe for more information.

It’s always a good idea to call 311, as they will have a full listing of buildings that have had reports of bed bugs. And finally we do recommend purchasing the plastic mattress cover. In case there ever is an issue, the mattress will remain protected.

What are your best remedies to keep moths out of woolens?  After they have made their presence, how do you get rid of them? ","Dear Nina,
If you suspect that your closet has been infested by moths or just want to take the appropriate measures to prevent it from happening, please follow the steps below: 

Tips for moth prevention 
• Wash all garments at the beginning of a new season and before packing at the end of one
• Clean drawers for the new season by washing, vacuuming and re-organizing them 
• Place Natural Lavender Sachets and Scented Drawer Sheets in Cedar in drawers and clothing storage units as cedar and lavender are natural moth and bug repellants
• Spray clothing with the Wool & Cashmere Spray as cedar is a natural moth and bug repellant 
• Store clothing in breathable fabric such as cotton or linen that has a zipper such as the All-Purpose Storage Bag
• Make sure to never store clothing in plastic or cardboard or in damp/humid areas 

Tips for post moth attacks 
• Place infected clothing in airtight bags and freeze for 72 hours – the harsh temperatures will kill any lingering insects
• Vacuum, dust and wash shelves and floors as moths feed on dust, dirt and body oils 
• Launder all clothing after freezing and cleaning is complete – if you cannot launder at home, we recommend Slate NYC, a green dry cleaning/laundering service (see below for contact information)
• Clean machine after washing infected items 
• Repair holes caused by moths immediately – we recommend Alter Knit for this job (see below for contact information)

How do you remove the scent of moth balls from clothing? I buy a lot of vintage and am also guilty of storing clothes with these nasty things!","Dear Lisa-
Eliminating the smell of mothballs from clothing can be a daunting task as mothballs are extremely stubborn!

For silk, wool and delicate items, I recommend soaking them in a bath of water and Scented Vinegar. Vinegar is known for its powerful cleansing properties that fight stains, buildup, odors and germs, so it will help rid your clothing of that potent mothball smell. The amount of vinegar added to the bath and the temperature of the water will vary according to the number of items being washed and their fabric composition. 

You can also add the vinegar directly to the washing drum (top loaders) or the detergent dispenser (front loaders) and run a wash cycle without detergent or softener. Follow the vinegar wash with a normal wash cycle.

When treating more durable fabrics such as cotton and linen, you can try soaking the items in a bath of hot water and All-Purpose Bleach Alternative for roughly 30 minutes. The All-Purpose Bleach Alternative is a nontoxic, fragrance-free alternative to chlorine bleach that is color friendly and will work to remove the odor as well. Treat the soak as a pretreating procedure and follow with a normal wash cycle after its completion.

We don’t make a product that includes bug repellent. You can add citronella oil to your wash cycle. However, I know deet is supposed to be applied to the fabric not skin.

You can also try washing with our Wool & Cashmere Shampoo as the cedar scent naturally repels bugs and moths. For added protection, spray your clothing with Wool & Cashmere Spray which is also scented an cedar and will keep the yarns of your clothing fresh!

How do you recommend cleaning a wool blend men's suit?  We found bug damage to our wool sweaters, which are in the same closet as my husband's suits. The only damage I saw to his suits was one lapel with a shaved-looking spot on the surface.  Any special considerations we should account for given the potential for bugs? Also, can his suit be fixed? I just ordered your Wool & Cashmere Shampoo and Spray, and some Lavender sachets and cotton cube storage bags for better prevention!  ","Dear Katie,
Silverfish will leave the fabric with a ""shaved"" appearance on the surface. All clothing items should be laundered and the shelves vacuumed and wiped down as these bugs feed on dirt, dust and any body oils left on fabrics.  

You can launder men's suits with the Wool & Cashmere Shampoo in the machine on a delicate/woolen cycle with cold water.  Remove from the machine promptly and hang to dry, steaming while damp is best to reduce creasing.  For blazers be sure to use a sturdy hanger to support the shoulders and stuff the sleeves to help keep form.  I've linked our recipe for washing suits and blazers below. http://blog.thelaundress.com/wordpress/project/recipe-for-washing-suits-blazers/

Please note that blazers with viscose/rayon linings have the potential to shrink.  For these items we recommend Slate NYC, as they are a green dry cleaner.  Items that are in need of mending should be brought to a tailor. If you are in NYC we recommend Miriam at Alter Knit.  While she can repair almost any hole or snag, you will have to ask about repairs for the finish.  

To prevent the appearance of silverfish, be sure that clothing items are always laundered prior to being stored.  Clothing in seasonal storage should be kept in breathable cotton bags with a zip closure and placing lavender sachets in closets and storage is a natural way to repel bugs and moths.

2/27/2013,Jennifer,"Dear Laundress-
With regard to storing clothing, shoes, and handbags, I live in FL and don't deal with seasonal storage, but do face some challenges storing both day-to-day and rarely-used items. The most notable challenge is protecting my items from pests such as silverfish and moths.

Pest control companies recommend storing in airtight plastic containers and avoiding storage vessels containing starch, proteins, sugar, paper/cardboard, etc. My dry cleaner scolded me for using plastic dust covers over hanged items and recommended using the paper dust covers that the cleaner supplies. Is there any storage material that will protect my wardrobe from pests, dust, and deterioration/yellowing? My closet has become my adversary! ","Dear Jennifer-
I understand the frustration. Unfortunately, both are right for different reasons. We recommend storing in cotton, however! 

Cotton is the most effective medium for storage as moths will not eat through it. We avoid storing in plastic containers because such storage tends to induce yellowing. As for paper covers, we aren't quiet sure which insects can penetrate through. All in all, cotton is your best bet!

If silverfish is the main problem, the solution will be slightly different. Silverfish eat cotton and linen, especially those treated with starch, but will not harm 100% synthetic fabrics. In this case, you can store natural fabrics and blends in a synthetic material bag.

My husband buys expensive designer shirts and has had so many ruined by the dry cleaners! 

He has several 100% cotton shirts that are either medium gray or light gray. Would you suggest washing these in Signature Detergent, Darks Detergent or Denim Wash as some are chambray and flannel? What about a 100% cotton shirt that's black and white checked?

He also owns several Prada shirts in a range of colors. These are all 72% cotton, 23% nylon, and 5% elastane. Is the scent of your Delicate Wash too feminine for a man?

His Prada dress shirts are 54% polyester, 46% silk and actually say no water. Should we take that to heart?","Dear Kim-
Your husband can use the Darks Detergent for both his medium and light grey shirts as this detergent is formulated with a color guard and will work to protect the dyes from fading. You can use the same product for the checked black and white shirt.  

Regarding your husband's Prada tops and dress shirts, again you can use the Darks Detergent, as we choose the product based on the highest fabric percentage and both cotton and polyester are very washable.  

We suggest washing in tepid water on a delicate cycle. You can use Mesh Washing Bags for extra protection.  Once the wash cycle is complete, remove promptly from the machine and hang to dry.  Steaming while damp is best to reduce creasing and will make pressing easier. 

I’ve also linked to our recipe on washing dress shirts.  I hope this helps!

To care for your cotton jacket, I recommend washing with the Signature Detergent. Scented in our Classic scent, the Signature Detergent combines surfactants, color guard and stain fighting enzymes to whiten, brighten and preserve color while removing stains. If your jacket has hardware, such as zippers, buttons or snaps, you should turn it inside out and put it in a Mesh Bag before washing in the washing machine. This will prevent your jacket from snagging and protect its hardware.

You can launder your cotton plaid shirt in the machine with our Signature Detergent.  100% cotton is very durable and typically prewashed to avoid shrinking.  However, if the sewn-in care label suggests “Dry Clean Only” then we recommend laundering in cold water. Remove promptly from the machine and hang to dry, pressing while damp will help to reduce creasing.  To avoid shrinking- always launder in cold water and avoid the dryer.

Depending on the severity of the stain you may need to repeat this process.

I recommend soaking the item in cool water and rinsing repeatedly. I am hesitant to use Stain Solution or a detergent because you don't want any discoloration.

Dear Laundress-
Is there any hope for yellowing sheets and pillow cases that are 50% polyester?  ","Dear Vernon-
Polyester is a very washable fabric and we have some great suggestions to help whiten and brighten your yellowing sheets!

First, combine the All-Purpose Bleach Alternative and Stain Solution to create a powerful cleaning paste by applying the Stain Solution directly to the affected areas and sprinkling the bleach alternative on top. We suggest using our Stain Brush, or an extra toothbrush, to lather this paste into the fibers. Follow by soaking your items in warm water with the All-Purpose Bleach Alternative for roughly 30 minutes.
                
We use our All-Purpose Bleach Alternative in our everyday laundry. The All-Purpose Bleach Alternative is an oxygen bleach that is a natural stain remover and deodorizer and is color safe. You can pour it directly into the washing machine with our Signature Detergent to help brighten your sheets! 
  
Do not be discouraged if your items do not brighten after one wash. We often treat items a few times before getting optimal results, especially if the discoloration has set in over time.

Linen and cotton are the most washable fabrics and are best cleaned when washed.
The concern with laundering, especially with drapery, is shrinkage and stretching. If the goods were not prewashed, there is a good chance the
length may change. 

It is a tricky situation- the dry cleaning process generally has less
shrinkage, but has other negative effects. And laundering may have length
issues. For minimal shrinkage, wash in cold water with low agitation or on the delicate cycle, and lay flat to dry. Do not put the drapes in the dryer or hang them as you do not want them to elongate if stressed. Press while damp to achieve the best results.

Please test the blue velvet alone, separating it from the linen, in water to see if it releases dye when wet. 

Velvet is piece dyed, so there is a good chance it may release color. If it does release color, separate the front and the back and proceed with spot treatment using the Wash & Stain Bar on the front. Just make certain that the front and back are not touching when treating/ drying!

If the velvet is dye fast or does not bleed, you can proceed with washing and treating the entire case. If the velvet is made from a silk, woolen or cashmere fiber, then you must use the Delicate Wash or Wool & Cashmere Shampoo accordingly. If it is made from a synthetic or polyester, you can use the Signature Detergent and All-Purpose Bleach Alternative.

Is it true that soaking my dark jeans in vinegar and water before washing will seal in the dye?","Dear Erin-
Basically, vinegar is an acid and an acid, such as acid washing, generally does the adverse to color preservation.

Below is information I found about hand dyed yarns and color-fasting them. You will see vinegar is suggested as a fixative, however it states that this doesn't work on cotton which is denim. The most aggressive attempt is to lock in dye would be to use the dharma dye fixative. 

Mohair is usually dyed with acid dyes. If a scarf was dyed with acid dyes but was not fixed properly, it might help to heat it in a cooking pot in the presence of an acid, such as vinegar. (Note that this will never work with cotton, but may work with animal fibers such as mohair.) However, you should never use a cooking pot that is intended for food use, because the dye is probably not safe to eat, and tiny amounts of stains might persist to contaminate future uses of the pot. Also, there is no guarantee that the dyer did not use a different dye type, in which case this would not help.

The best suggestion I have for you is to mail-order a commercial dye fixative. Cationic dye fixatives such as Retayne, Raycafix, or Dharma Dye Fixative will fix most dyes, though they do not work on vat dyes such as indigo, nor on basic dyes. You will have to mail-order your Retayne or other brand of this product; most dye retailers online will sell it. These commercial dye fixative products are very useful for fixing the dye in almost any commercial garment that is not washfast, so it is good to have some on hand. Retayne is supposed to be added in hot water, which you may wish to avoid, but Dharma Dye Fixative is supposed to be added to a cold water rinse, which is less worrisome for your mohair. Of course, Dharma Dye Fixative is sold only by Dharma Trading Company, but other dye suppliers may have their own brand names of the same product.

Our Denim Wash and Darks Detergent is great because it's designed to remove the micro fuzz which clouds the fabric. As for color loss, we have color guard in our products, yet we can't prevent the dye from entirely releasing as this is an issue with fabric.
Most fading actually occurs in the dryer. We also recommend a shorter wash cycle in cooler water.

How do you get gasoline out of clothes? I just got it all over an expensive pair of blue jeans. I have washed them twice already in cold water with lots of detergent and the smell is still there. Have not dried them. Help!","Dear Linda-
White vinegar, such as our Scented Vinegar, works wonders to remove odors! Presoak the jeans for up to one hour in tepid water with ¼ cup of vinegar. Next, pretreat with our Wash & Stain Bar. Wet the area, and work the bar into the fabric. It is specifically make for grease and oil stains so it should help immensely. Finally, launder as normal with our Denim Wash. 

Please note that items sometimes need to be treated twice, especially for tough stains like gasoline. Do not be discouraged if the smell and stain are not removed after one treatment!

I'm interested in getting one of your brushes but am not sure which one is best. I have cashmere sweaters I'd love to fluff up. My main concern is lint and dog hair on my clothes, specifically my darker sweaters and corduroys. I generally use a lint roller but find that it doesn't do the job and leaves behind lots of pills on my sweaters which makes them look dirty. Which brush do you think would be best? ","Dear Caroline-
To remove lint and pet hair from your cashmere sweaters and corduroy pieces, I recommend using the Pet & Lint Brush. It’s our best and strongest lint removing brush and will not leave behind damage – far better than any lint roller! It’s safe for wool and cashmere garments and will be great with the pet hair. 

To care specifically for cashmere items however, we recommend the Cashmere Brush as it will help fluff up and rejuvenate the natural oil in the yarns of your clothing. Spritzing the garments with Wool & Cashmere Spray between wearing and washing will also help preserve the fibers.

How do you prevent cashmere from pilling?","Dear Patsy-
Our best recommendation to prevent the pilling of cashmere would be to wash your item with the Wool & Cashmere Shampoo and brush it in between washes with the Cashmere Brush. The Wool & Cashmere Shampoo works to safely clean and preserve the natural components of yarns while the Cashmere Brush is ideal for removing lint, cleaning the fine yarns and rejuvenating its natural oils. This will help to remove the loose fibers that will eventually form pilling if left unkempt. 

As pilling is a result of the friction from wearing your clothing rather than washing, some pilling is bound to happen. When this occurs, you can remove the pills with a Sweater Stone or Sweater Comb. 

Below is one of our blog posts that covers how to treat your clothing before and after pilling occurs.

When would I use the Sweater Stone vs the Sweater Comb? The elbows of my sweaters always pill because they rub on my desk. They're mostly wool and cashmere.","Dear Neal-
We recommend using the Sweater Stone for thicker woolen fabrics, such as double-knit sweaters or wool coats. The Sweater Stone is a gentle pumice that picks up pills while leaving behind renewed yarns. The Sweater Comb works well for de-pilling finer, more delicate woolens or cashmere garments and consists of two fine mesh metal screens on a cedar handle. 

If most of your sweaters are made up of delicate fabrics, you should opt for the Sweater Comb.  If your sweaters consist of thicker, more durable fabrics then the Sweater Stone would be more appropriate.

Could you give me instructions for washing a down comforter? ","Dear Hannah,
We recommend using our Wool & Cashmere Shampoo to launder down. It is safe to use in any type of machine and perfect for the gentle down stuffing in your comforter.  

You should pour the shampoo directly into the drum of your machine. Make sure to choose the cold cycle as well as the delicate or woolens cycle on your machine. 

Dry down in the dryer to help fluff up the feathers and return the volume to the comforter. For best results, we suggest adding 2-3 dryer balls to the dryer. This fluffs up the down even more.

I have accidentally spilled coffee  on my duvet which ended up going through to the duvet cover and, last but not least, to the down comforter! How do I best clean up the smell and stain?  Do you use something special in the dryer to fluff the down?  ","Dear Elaine-
To remove the odor on both the duvet and comforter, we suggest presoaking with our Scented Vinegar. Make a cool water bath with ¼ to ½ cup of the vinegar and allow the stain to soak for up to one hour. There is no need to submerge the entire item; only soak the coffee stained areas. 

If the duvet is a cotton or cotton blend, I recommend tackling the coffee stain with Stain Solution and All-Purpose Bleach Alternative. Wet the stained area and apply the Stain Solution directly to the fabric, gently working it in with our Stain Brush. Next, apply the bleach alterative on top of the solution to make a paste. Let this item soak between 30-60 minutes and launder as normal.

Treat the staining on your down comforter with our Stain Solution, only. Please note that the Bleach Alternative cannot be used on woolens, cashmere, silks or delicate synthetic fabrics, such as your down comforter. If your item is made from one of these fabrics, do not use the Bleach Alternative. The Stain Solution, however, is safe for all fabrics but should only be used in conjunction with cold water for these items.  

Both items can be laundered in the machine. Assuming the duvet is cotton or cotton blend, we suggest our laundering with our Signature Detergent. In effect, the duvet should be safe to put in the dryer. 

For the down comforter, we suggest our Wool & Cashmere Shampoo; this is specifically formulated to sustain the life of delicate down feathers. You can let it air dry. Once dry, add to the dryer. For best results, we include 2-3 tennis balls or dryer balls in the machine to fluff up the down.

You can certainly launder your down pillows. Depending on the size of your machine, you may need to wash 1 or 2 at a time, as you do not want to overload.  

Pretreat any staining with Stain Solution and then launder on a delicate/woolen cycle in cold water with Wool & Cashmere Shampoo.  

Remove promptly and tumble dry- low temperature setting.  We recommend using clean tennis balls to help deter clumping and to ""fluff"" the down. Remove promptly, while still damp and allow the pillows to air dry to finish.  Be sure the pillows are completely dry, as you do not want them to mildew from the inside out.

I have finally created the wardrobe of my dreams over the last two years. My treasures include several lovely Dries Van Noten cashmere and wool sweaters and Mayle silk dresses. 

Alas, I've had my first silk dress dry cleaning mishap and one of my Mayle dresses - a sort of matte, thick silk material - came back looking as though it had been left in the press too long. It was a stiff material with chemical residue spots. 

So my questions are, is it not better to hand wash most silks, cashmeres and wool? If so, what products would you recommend?
","Dear Elizabeth-
Your wardrobe sounds fantastic! Keep those pieces away from the drycleaner!

We hand wash all our delicates, such as silks, laces and embroidery, with our
Delicate Wash. We also machine wash these items in Mesh Bags on the delicate/gentle cycle. When drying, we always line dry or lay the garment flat in its natural shape.

I recommend washing your stiff dress and see if you can redeem it! It is also helpful, especially with silks, to have a steamer to revive that silky luster after it is dried.

To care for your wools and cashmeres, follow our washing wool and cashmere recipe on our website. You should use our Wool & Cashmere Shampoo when treating such items.

The only blend or fiber which is unpredictable is rayon. I learned this lesson years ago with a Diane von Fustenberg wrap dress which shrunk to a mini T-shirt.

Are you using bleach or color safe bleach? Are you using a machine that has other loads washed with bleach? This seems the most likely to me if it's only happening on certain areas of the item.

If this is happening on one item, such as an identical T-shirt that you purchased in different colors, then it could be the item and the way it was dyed. If the bleaching look appears on all items, it may be your detergent or bleach sneaking around in your washing area.

Allow the item to soak in a bath with hot water, the longer the better. Depending on the severity of the stain you may need to repeat this pretreating/soaking process.

ABSOLUTELY NOT! If you want whites to be white, I do not recommend washing them with jeans or any other colored fabrics. Just buy extra T's and underwear instead.

You can also run two or three loads at a time if you have more than one machine. Try separating your dirty clothes into two bags in your room when you undress.

If you want to shrink your jeans the best you can do is wash with hot water and dry them on hot.  However, we cannot guarantee shrinkage as we don’t know what the manufacturer did in terms of pre-wash/pre-shrink.  The color should be fine.

When ironing your black shirts, you should turn down the heat on your iron. You can also iron on the wrong side of the fabric, and for added protection you can use a light cloth between the iron and black garment.

As for ironing board covers, you should look for one that is thick, has extra padding and is stain and scorch resistant. Our Ironing board cover offers just that and is made to fit both standard and European ironing boards. It is also designed with elastic edges that give it an extra secure fit!

I'm a vintage collector and have A LOT of head scarves of various different fabrics. Most of these are rayon, silk, nylon and polyester or a combination of the materials. I'm wondering if it's possible to hand wash them all together using Delicate Wash, or whether I need to treat some of them differently. I'm also not sure what to do with a couple or Chiffon scarves that I have. ","Dear Kirsten-
Thank you for reaching out. Luckily, scarves are easy to care for. You can hand wash your scarves in Delicate Wash which is safe for a multitude of fabrics including silk, rayon, nylon, ramie and acetate. When washing, make sure to wash by color groups in case any color release occurs. If the water discolors because of dirt or color release, you will need to refresh the bath and/or wash the scarves one after the other as needed.

As chiffon is typically made of silk, nylon or rayon, washing with the Delicate Wash would be appropriate. Below I’ve included links to our Can I Be Washed? chart which details how to care for different fabric types as well as our recipe for washing Silks and Delicates.

I started to notice what looks like oil stains or spots on mine and my kids clothes after having been washed and dryed. What could that be from and how can I prevent it from happening?","Dear Simone-
My best recommendation would be to first clean your washing machine and dryer.  

Try running a long washing load using hot water with Scented Vinegar and All-Purpose Bleach Alternative and follow with a long load with just hot water to thoroughly rinse.  

For your dryer, use a sponge or Lint-Free Cleaning Cloth with All-Purpose Cleaning Concentrate and wipe the inside of the dryer drum. 

With regards to your laundry, you can pretreat the stains with Stain Solution. Depending on the severity, you may need to make a bath with All-Purpose Bleach Alternative and hot water and allow the items to soak.  Once you are satisfied with the stain removal, you can then launder as normal.

How do I remove mold/mildew from my outdoor cushions made of canvas?","Dear Georgina-
We have some awesome tips to help kill and remove mold or mildew buildup on fabric. Canvas is especially easy to launder—so that's great! 

Brush loose mold off the fabrics. For this, we recommend our Stain Brush. It has tough bristles, which are important to effectively remove the mold. Apply the Stain Solution and All-Purpose Bleach Alternative directly onto the moldy area and scrub well. 

If your cushion covers are removable, make a warm water bath with our Scented Vinegar and let covers soak. The longer the better! Use about ¼ cup vinegar per item and change out dirty water when necessary. The vinegar also works to remove odors. 

After the soak, launder as normal with hot water. Our Signature Detergent works well for canvas material. 

Do not be discouraged if the results are not perfect after one wash. In this instance, we treat items multiple times for best results. Be mindful to not put items with staining in the dryer. This will bake in the stains and make it more difficult to remove in the second wash.

For items such as shirts or sweaters, we have the All-Purpose Storage Bags, the Storage Cube and Storage Bags. These products will work well to prevent any damage. The breathable cotton canvas material keeps out any bugs that can harm your clothing.  

For dresses, outerwear and other items that you want to hang, we recommend these garment bags from the Container Store. The natural cotton canvas material will allow your items to breathe.

I have a trench coat from Burberry. It is black and made of cotton/nylon with a detachable liner. It says to ""Dry Clean Only."" Do you suggest any products that could help me keep it looking and feeling clean? As you know, coats need cleaning from time to time! ","Dear Stephanie-
We have washed many Burberry trench coats and had great success! Since it is a cotton/nylon blend, you can wash the coat with either our Signature or Darks Detergent. Be sure to wash the coat and lining separately. Once the coat has been treated, hang to dry. To keep your coat feeling and smelling fresh during day to day use, try spraying it with one of our scented Fabric Fresh sprays.

I've gotten faser fir tree sap on my black Moncler coat. Help!","Dear Kathleen-
To help remove the tree sap from your jacket and get it back to that “straight off the hanger” look, please try the steps below.

Pretreat: Lather the Wash & Stain Bar with tepid water and gently work it into the sap mark.
  
Wash: Machine wash on the delicate/woolens cycle with cold water adding the appropriate amount of Wool & Cashmere Shampoo.

Dry: Dry in your dryer on low heat and the low tumble cycle, adding clean tennis balls to help fluff up the down filing. 

Tips: Steaming your coat between washes will remove mites and allergens, while spraying with Wool & Cashmere Spray will help it stay fresh with its anti-bacterial properties.

Below is a link to our blog post that provides further detail on caring for down.

I have a sweater that is 100% cotton with leather trim.  If the label says ""Dry Clean Only,"" can I hand wash with Delicate Wash?","Dear Heidi-
We've been very successful with laundering sweaters with leather trim in the past.  While leather can sometimes discolor when wet however, we always recommend that you test a small area of the trim prior to laundering.  

Make a bath with cool water, wet a small section of the leather and allow it to air dry.  If all seems okay, you can then go ahead and launder by hand with our Wool & Cashmere Shampoo. 

When hand washing, make a bath of cool water and Wool & Cashmere Shampoo and allow the sweater to soak for 30 minutes. Rinse well under cool water and press the water out, never wring or twist.  Lay flat to dry and steam while damp to reduce creasing.

You can try spot cleaning it with Stain Solution, but be careful because you may end up with water rings. You also don't want to rub too aggressively and distort the nap of the wool.

We do not recommend washing if it has any form like interfacing and padding for the shoulders, lapel, ect.

Our Delicate Wash is most suitable for silk. I would pretreat the stained area with our Stain Solution and soak and rinse before washing with Delicate Wash.

However, if there are shoulder pads or interfacing in the suit jacket, you need to dry clean as spot treating silk is tricky.  Treating only one area of a silk garment usually leaves a ring so the whole item needs to be soaked at the same time.

If the suit has been dry cleaned already, the stain is more set in and stain removal will be a bit more difficult.

Thank you for reaching out! When the sportswear says “Do not lay on itself when wet,” I think it is referring to the drying process after laundering, not the interim period before wearing and washing. High-tech sportswear fabrics are created with sweat wicking technology for quick dry. However, these fabrics will lose their sweat wicking and elastic properties if dried in the dryer. They should always be laid flat or hung to dry for best results.

Chlorine bleach is usually the culprit in yellowing bathing suits. To give the suit the most thorough cleaning, start by presoaking. Apply Scented Vinegar into any odorous areas, followed by Stain Solution. Allow the suit to soak.

After the pretreating process, you can proceed with laundering. We always recommend hand washing bathing suits. Prepare a warm water bath and add a capful of our Sport Detergent. Agitate the water with your hands and allow the suit to soak for thirty minutes. After washing, rinse the suit well and press out any excess water. Be careful not to ring or twist. Lay the suit flat to dry.
 
For next time, always wash and rinse your suits as soon as possible after wearing in order to best preserve them! I have included a link to our Washing Swimwear recipe to help guide you in the process.

I recently bought a black wooldress. Unfortunately, after the first wear, my deodorant left unsightly marks in the armpit area. What is the best way to remove these marks? ","Dear Mary,
To remove the deodorant stains from your wool dress, please follow the instructions below:

Pretreat: Lather the Wash & Stain Bar with cool or tepid water and gently work it into the stained areas. For added cleaning power, put the affected area under the faucet and let the water pressure work into the stain. Follow by soaking the dress in a bath of cool water for up to 30 minutes. If the stain is not completely gone by the end of the soak, you may need to repeat this process.

Wash: Machine wash using the appropriate amount of Wool & Cashmere Shampoo. Make sure to select the delicate/woolens cycle on your machine and wash in cold water. 

Dry: Place the dress on top of a towel making sure they are both flat and in their original shape. Roll up the dress in the towel to remove excess water. Lay the dress flat in its natural shape to dry.

How do I get rid of yellow underarm stains and body odor from white shirts?  ","Hi Denise-
Our detergent should remove the odor from the items in the wash cycle. If that isn't suffiecient however, we recommend a wash cycle with a 1/2 cup of vinegar followed by a wash cycle with Whites Detergent. It is best to use hot water, especially with the vinegar cycle. 

As for sweat or pit stains we have a recipe:
- Apply Stain Solution directly to the discolored area.
- Pour hot water on the area and let soak for an hour or so. I use a kettle and do this process in a rubber bin.
- Repeat this process until satisfied. I usually do it two or three times.

How to remove blood stains from a linen slipcover? Dry cleaning did not work.","Dear Lisa-
We have some great stain removal recipes that work for items even after they’ve been dry cleaned.
 
The Stain Solution works well for tannin stains such as blood. As linen is very easy to launder, we suggest using the All-Purpose Bleach Alternative as well.
 
For a tough stain that has set in, pretreat with the Stain Solution and the All-Purpose Bleach Alternative. They make a type of paste when combined. The All-Purpose Bleach alternative is an oxygen-based bleach and is safe for all colors. Wet the stained area and apply the products directly onto the stain. Make sure to work it into the fabric and let soak in a warm/hot water bath. Add some more All-Purpose Bleach Alternative to the bath. 

Finally, launder as normal. Again, you can pour another capful of bleach alternative into the drum of the washing machine.

I have an 11-year-old daughter who loves chocolate ice cream which she usually gets on her clothes.  Any advice for removing chocolate?","Dear Hollis-
Oh, chocolate.  This is relatively easy to remove if treated properly.  For best results, apply Stain Solution directly on the area and soak in hot water. Only use hot water when treating cotton garments. Silk, wool and more delicate fibers should be treated with cooler water temperatures. 

Repeat until you notice progress then wash in a regular cycle.  Do not put the item in the dryer if the stain is still there, instead repeat the pretreating process and the stain will lift.

I have a chocolate syrup stain that won't come out of one of my favorite white Ralph Lauren shirts. Any suggestions?","Dear Michael-
That should totally come out, especially if the shirt is cotton. Just follow the steps below!

Pretreat with Stain Solution by applying it directly to the stain and gently working it into the fabric. If your shirt is cotton or linen, you can sprinkle All-Purpose Bleach Alternative into the Stain Solution to create a powerful cleaning paste. Pouring hot water onto the stain will also help with stain removal.

Launder with Whites Detergent in hot water. Be mindful not to dry until the stain is completely removed as to not set it in.

It is hard to say if the stain will come out after it has been dry cleaned. It is always tougher to remove stains that have been set in by dry cleaning. You can try to spot treating it with Stain Solution and water. You will want to work in the solution into the stain with little agitation.

That is the only thing I don't miss about London. I even had black in my nose!

To remove the dirt from your collar and cuffs, pretreat with the Wash & Stain Bar by lathering it with water and gently working it into the fabric.

I just washed and dried two new Ralph Lauren Polo shirts that I thought were okay to wash together. One was an orange and the other a light purple.  Now the orange is stained only on banded collar and sleeves.  Did I just ruin the shirt or can you offer suggestions?","Dear Logan-
My best recommendation would be to apply the Stain Solution directly to stained areas and then make a bath with tepid water and allow to soak. If treating cotton, you can use hot water. You may need to repeat the pretreating and soaking process, as dye transfer can be stubborn.  Once you are satisfied with the removal you can then launder as normal.

Chewing gum is nasty to pick off, plus you need to be mindful not to nap or pill the fabric.  Some suggest ice to harden it and crack it off.  It all depends on how topical the gum is. You can try goo-gone - I have used it to remove duct tape from a car interior.

Thank you for reaching out. To help tackle the white, powdery gum stain on your jacket, please try the recommended steps below.
 
Pretreat: Lather the Wash & Stain Bar with warm water and gently work it into the affected area. Follow by soaking the item in a bath of lukewarm water for 30 minutes. If the stain is not completely gone, repeat this process until satisfied.
 
Wash: Machine wash the jacket using the appropriate amount of Wool & Cashmere Shampoo and selecting the woolens/delicate cycle and cold water. Make sure to turn the item inside out and place in a Mesh Bag.        
        
Dry: Place the jacket on top of a towel in its original shape and roll up the towel to remove excess water. To finish drying, lay the item flat in its natural shape.

Help! I have a silk top with a small ink stain on the front. How can I remove it?","Dear Carolyn-
Pen is difficult to remove, but not impossible. For this, I would recommend tackling the stains with the Stain Solution and/or Wash & Stain Bar. Wet the stained area and apply the Stain Solution/Wash & Stain Bar directly to the fabric. Make sure you work it into the stain, allowing the solution to get into the fibers. Let this item soak for about 30 minutes and hand wash with our Delicate Wash in cold water.
 
Agitate with your hands to make sure the garment is evenly soaped and let soak for about 30 minutes. Rinse the item and lay flat to dry. Steaming while damp will help to reduce wrinkles and is totally safe for all fabrics.
 
Do not be discouraged if the stain doesn’t come out at first. We often have to treat tough stains two or three times before they are successfully removed.

Do you have a solution to remove makeup, such as foundation or tinted sunscreen from shirts?  I've used Carbona, but it's only available in small bottles.  ","Dear Lisa-
We have a few different products that are great to remove stubborn stains.  
 
Apply our Stain Solution directly to the stain. Agitate and work the Stain Solution into the fabric using our Stain Brush. The Stain Solution is safe to use on all fabrics.
 
For extra stubborn stains, you can combine the Stain Solution and the All-Purpose Bleach Alternative to make a paste. Again, work into the fabric. Next, presoak the item with the All-Purpose Bleach Alternative. If it is cotton, linen or polyester, it is safe to soak with warm/hot water. Remove from water and launder as normal.
 
The All-Purpose Bleach Alternative is oxygen bleach and is color safe. However, do not use on any garment that cannot be bleached, such as silk, woolen or cashmere. 
 
Do not be discouraged if the stains do not immediately come out. We often launder items a few times before we get optimal results. This usually happens with stains that have set in over a long time.

Last summer I wore a floor length, black velvet Jasper Conran dress to an outdoors event.  The bottom two inches are now covered in dried mud and no dry cleaner will help.  Any advice?","Dear Hannah-
Has this poor frock been wadded in a ball since or is it too painful to look at? I'm not sure if it is a cotton velvet, silk velvet, or acetate velvet or if there is a lining involved, but it sounds like this is a last resort.

My recommendations would be to:
-Be mindful of the velvet as it is similar to terry cloth which are small loops cut to create the lush pile. When wiping the fabric be careful you don't flatten the fibers. If the mud is heavily clumped, I would gently comb as much of the crusty stuff as you can.

-Put the dress in the sink or tub and hit the taps using cold water to rinse it. Fingers crossed that the mud will come out! You can use our Wash & Stain Bar, and/or Delicate Wash for the mud stain. 

-Hang to dry.

If the velvet is a bit funky after washing, steam the area or have a dry cleaner professionally steam it to lift the pile.

I have a big mystery on my hands! When cleaning out closets of clothes not worn for a long period of time, I discovered white and light colored clothes had brownish stains of various sizes. All had been laundered, and a sweater that had even been dry cleaned. Some people said they have seen this, but no one knew why. ","Dear Beverly-
Fret not! Yellowing is not from little critters, but is common from storing.

Causes:
-Using chlorine bleach on silk, wool, or spandex when iron or manganese is in the water supply - the bleach will intensify this and installing a water filter will help eliminate the problem.
-Sealing or storing items in nonbreathable plastic  - condensation forms amongst the seasons which causes yellowing.

Below are methods for treating such stains.
-Boil water and add items to the pot, stirring and simmering it. Follow with a machine wash using Whites Detergent and line dry in the sun.

- Pretreat discolored areas with Stain Solution, gently working the solution into the fabric. Leave to soak in a bath of tepid water for roughly 30 minutes and launder as usual.

How can I remove pearlised lilac nail-polish from a crinkle viscose black dress? Nail-polish remover has proved ineffective,  and I am afraid that any other solutions might set it, or ruin the fabric completely.  Any suggestions are gratefully received!","Dear Charlotte-
This is a really bad combination!  I suggest putting a super hot iron on the area with a fine cloth between iron and fabric to absorb the melted nail polish. You must first test a hidden area of the dress to make sure that it won’t ruin the viscose or crush the crinkle.

The other options are chemical such as turpentine or a solvent called Afta, which is a liquid solvent similar to that of a dry cleaner solution. Either are available in a hardware store or a John Lewis kind of place.

I'm an avid fan of the Wool & Cashmere Shampoo and just spilled nail polish on part of a cashmere blanket. Thankfully it blends a bit, but can you suggest anything to help get it out? Should I use acetone or nail polish remover?
","Dear Courtney-
Unfortunately removing nail polish can be very difficult, as you will need to use nail polish remover which can be damaging to the delicate cashmere yarns. My best recommendation would be to use a Q-tip and gently apply the polish remover to the stained areas. We cannot guarantee that this will not harm the yarns, however. 

You should treat the area immediately after with our Wash & Stain Bar, wetting the bar and working it into the fabric.  Once you are satisfied with the results you can then launder in cold water with the Wool & Cashmere Shampoo. Remove promptly from the machine, lay flat to dry and steam while damp for best results.

I have an expensive, polyester dress that I love and bought 2005. Returning from a holiday abroad, an oily skincare product leaked in my suitcase, resulting in a circular oily stain about the size of an old penny.  I have washed the garment several times, rubbing and scrubbing. The oily circle is a little less noticeable than at the start, but still visible! Is it too late to do anything to improve the situation?  Please advise.","Dear Patricia-
I am afraid this stain is a bit old, but it is worth a shot. Some fibers take in oils more than others, polyester being one as it is a synthetic material.

I recommend two things when treating durable fibers such as cotton and cotton blends:

First
- Work the Wash & Stain Bar directly into the stained area.
- Run hot water onto stain and soak in a basin for roughly an hour.
- If stain has faded but isn't completely gone, repeat the process and treat until satisfied. 
- After pretreating, wash with Signature Detergent.

Second
Try and find a product called Stain Devils. It is a German company sold in the U.S. in yellow bottles.  You can find them at some large grocery stores or John Lewis.  The ingredient you are looking for is the enzyme lipase which is specifically for oil.

Usually the yellow stains are from rust in the water or washing machine.  In general, it is helpful to maintain your machine by running an empty, full load with hot water and bleach.  This process is also important to do with an anti-rust liquid that you can purchase at a hardware store.

If your machine is brand new, it may be some rust from the water source/pipes. We recommend soaking the spotted area in hot water with our Stain Solution for an hour and repeating the process to lift completely.

The most appropriate product for the removal of red wine stains is our Stain Solution. It is specifically formulated to tackle tannin stains, such as red wine, so it should be able to do the trick! 

Just apply the Stain Solution directly to the affected area and gently work it into the fabric. For a more stubborn stain, sprinkle the All-Purpose Bleach Alternative onto the Stain Solution to make a powerful cleaning paste. Follow by soaking the item in a bath of water, the hotter the better, for up to 30 minutes and launder as usual.","S-020, H-01, S-001",Stains,Wine & Alcohol

I recently took a bunch of sweaters out of storage in a basement which included about a dozen cashmere sweaters. I took these along with all of my suits, which included a Polo Ralph Lauren Cashmere sport coat to the dry cleaners because I was afraid of moths. I don’t think they have ever been dry cleaned before. My question is, did this ruin them? ","Dear David-
You can absolutely launder your cashmere sweaters with our Wool & Cashmere Shampoo. If any of the sweaters have embellishments, we do suggest hand washing. Otherwise, you can launder in the machine with like colors.
 
Pretreat any staining with our Wash & Stain Bar. If you choose to launder in the machine, turn item inside out and place in a mesh bag. Add our Wool & Cashmere Shampoo directly into the drum or detergent dispenser. Make sure the machine is set to the Delicate or Woolen cycle. Most importantly, the water temperature must be cold/cold or risk shrinkage. 
 
Sport jackets only need to be laundered about once a year. For your Ralph Lauren cashmere sport coat, it might be best to bring it to a green dry cleaner, such as Slate NYC. The green cleaners will help to keep the structure of the coat. We have a washing service where we do launder cashmere sport coats. However, the process is more time consuming and requires other equipment, such as a steamer, which you might not have in your home. I've included the contact information for Slate NYC below.

My husband's beautiful Tom Ford suit pants got red wine spilled all over it tonight. It's 100% wool, with 50% rayon and 50% silk lining. Should I follow your wool washing instruction and treat the stain with Stain Solution and wash with Wool & Cashmere Shampoo?  What if the stain does not come out after many hours of soaking? Will that ruined the pants?","Hello-
You can pretreat the wine stain with our Stain Solution, applying directly to the affected area.  Next, make a bath with cool/tepid water and allow the pants to soak for 30 minutes. You may need to repeat the pretreating and soaking process, soaking in increments of 30 minutes due to the silk lining.

Once the stain has been removed to your liking, you can then launder in the machine on a delicate/woolen cycle using cold water only with our Wool & Cashmere Shampoo.  We recommend using a Mesh Bag for extra protection. Make certain to remove the pants promptly from the wash to reduce creasing.  Do not use the dryer, rather lay the pants flat to dry and steam while damp.

The only thing I can suggest is to soak it in water. Removing water marks with dry cleaning chemicals is not effective. Try evening out the water with water. Soak the item, having the fibers equal out in the water absorption. Monitor it and rinse. You may want to use a touch of Stain Solution on the edge of the mark.

What is the best way to care for super 120s wool? I am going to be a lawyer and will be wearing a lot of suits, most of the fabric being made of super 120s wool. I don't usually sweat, but I'm more likely to do so in the summer. I just want to know how best to care for the fabric and keep it smelling fresh and wrinkle free so that I can look good for work.","Dear Michelle-
To keep you wool suits wrinkle free and smelling fresh, there are a few products I recommend.
 
Smelling Fresh
Our Fabric Fresh Classic is a fabric spray with antibacterial properties that removes odor and freshens clothing. It’s scented in our Classic scent which is a luxurious blend of lily of the valley, jasmine, lavender and ylang ylang with undertones of musk and rose. For best results, you should spray from 6 inches away.
 
We also have a fabric spray formulated especially for wool garments which is our Wool & Cashmere Spray. Scented in Cedar, a combination of fresh woody smells with sweet notes and spice, the Wool & Cashmere Spray has antibacterial properties that remove odors and freshen yarns in between wearing and washing. Cedar naturally repels bugs and moths and is ideal for items labeled “Dry Clean Only.”
 
Wrinkle Free
To reduce wrinkles, the Crease Release is a life saver! Crease Release removes wrinkles by relaxing fibers without weakening or damaging them. It is scented in our Classic scent, so it will leave your suits smelling great as well.
 
Steaming your suits between wears will not only remove creases and wrinkles, but will also help to reduce dry cleaning. Steaming will help freshen and relax fibers. The steamer we use here at The Laundress is the Jiffy Steamer.
 
The Clothing & Upholstery Brush is another great item to have for maintaining you wardrobe. It easily removes lint, fuzz, pills, hair and fur from your garments while smoothing out their fibers.

I purchased a silk & camel hair sport coat for my husband for a business trip and when he unpacked it after the trip, the belt that was hanging down the back of the jacket had melted slightly and left sticky residue in a black stripe. Dry cleaning twice hasn't helped and I'd like to try cleaning it myself.   Any suggestion or advice that you can offer would be really helpful.","Dear Sarah-
Yes, you can launder a camel hair sport coat! Our rule of thumb for blended fabric is to wash according to the highest percentage. i.e. if the item is 70% camel hair and 30% silk, wash with Wool & Cashmere Shampoo.
 
Pretreat the black stain with our Stain Solution and gently work the solution into the fabric with the Stain Brush. For stubborn stains, we recommend soaking for 1 hour. 

You can then launder in the machine on a delicate/woolen cycle with cold water. We recommend turning the item inside out and placing inside a large mesh washing bag if possible.  

Remove promptly from the machine and hang to dry. Steaming while damp is best to reduce wrinkles. Stuff the arms with paper towels to keep shape while drying.

How to remove a brownish stain from an antique ivory lace tablecloth? I think the stain was caused by red wine, but I'm not totally sure.
","Dear Ariel-
To successfully remove the stains from your lace tablecloth, follow our ""Pit Recipe"" stated below:

- Pretreat: Apply Stain Solution to the stain, gently working it into the soiled area with a Stain Brush. For added cleaning power, pour hot water from a height onto the stain to help work in the solution. If stain has faded, but isn’t completely gone, repeat the process until satisfied. You can also try adding All-Purpose Bleach Alternative to the Stain Solution to make a cleaning paste, which will also need to be worked into the fabric. The bleach alternative should not be used on silks, woolens or leather.

- Wash: Launder with hot water and Whites Detergent which combines color guard and enzymes optical brightener. Add All-Purpose Bleach Alternative directly to the drum of the washing machine for added whitening.

-Dry: Press out the water, never wring or twist. Hang to dry and steam for best results.

The lace is probably cotton, but it may also be silk or synthetic.
Assuming it is a cotton dress, you can use our Wash & Stain Bar to tacking any sweat stains from perspiration. Even if there are no visible stains, it is good to use this bar on effected areas, such as the underarms and collar. Simply wet the bar and apply it directly to the dress.

For dresses, outerwear and other items that you want to hang, we recommend garment bags from the Container Store. The natural cotton canvas material will allow your items to breathe and work to prevent yellowing.

Silk is a very washable fabric, just be sure to remove the black belt first and launder separate if necessary. My best recommendation would be to pretreat the staining with Stain Solution, you can then make a cold water bath with Delicate Wash and allow to soak for 30 minutes.

We completely understand your reluctance. We love white linens, which is why we developed several great products and tips that work to whiten your whites and keep them that way!
 
For items you already own, your first step is to presoak. Presoak with white vinegar. Make a warm bath with ½ cup of white vinegar, and let your linens soak for up to an hour.
 
For stain removal, do a second presoak in hot water with the All-Purpose Bleach Alternative. You can combine with our enzyme based Stain Solution to fight staining.
               
We use our bleach alternative in every load of white laundry.  The bleach alternative is an oxygen bleach that is unscented and color safe. It is a natural stain remover and deodorizer. You can pour it directly into the washing machine with our Whites Detergent to help brighten your towels!
 
Our Whites Detergent is formulated with enzymes to help keep your white clothes white. This product combines natural bleach alternative and stain fighting agents to lengthen the life of your white fabrics. The combination of the Whites Detergent and bleach alternative works magic!
 
For older items, do not be discouraged if your whites do not automatically whiten after one wash. We will often treat items a few times before getting optimal results, especially if the discoloration has set in over time. For new items, these techniques will help to ensure that they don’t discolor over time.

Usually the yellow stains are from rust in the water or washing machine.  In general, it is helpful to maintain your machine by running an empty, full load with hot water and bleach.  This process is also important to do with an anti-rust liquid that you can purchase at a hardware store.

If your machine is brand new, it may be some rust from the water source/pipes. We recommend soaking the spotted area in hot water with our Stain Solution for an hour and repeating the process to lift completely.

It sounds like your towels have had a pretty long life! With all of the wear-and-tear, wash cycles, natural body oils, lotions, etc. it’s to be expected that the towels would get a little dingy.

How do I get white fabric with spandex back to the origial bright white shade?","Dear Carrol-
As spandex synthetics love to take in and hold odor and stains, it can be tricky to get such garments with these fibers back in true form. The best treatment for whitening these fibers is with our All-Purpose Bleach Alternative and Stain Solution. 

Simply apply the Stain Solution directly to the discolored areas, gently work it into the fabric and add sprinkles of Bleach Alternative to make a paste. Next, presoak the item in a basin of hot water with 1 capful of the Bleach Alternative and follow with a regular laundering cycle. 

To prevent future dinginess, add 1 capful of the Bleach Alternative with your laundry detergent when machine washing. **Please note that the All-Purpose Bleach Alternative is not to be used on silks or woolens.

Which of your products washes and cares for alpaca sweaters? Most state ""Dry Clean Only"" and I'm wondering if this can be avoided. How do I wash such items?","Dear Sara-
You can wash these items and doing so is actually safer for the garments over time, as dry cleaning chemicals can be harsh and drying.  

Laundering with our Wool & Cashmere Shampoo will work to both clean and preserve the natural oils of the yarns. You can pretreat any staining with the Wash & Stain Bar and then launder in the machine with cold water, on a delicate/woolen cycle. You may also wash by hand. 

Remove promptly from the machine and lay flat to dry, do not use the dryer.  Steaming while damp is best to reduce creasing.

I have a make-up stain on my lilac cashmere sweater.  I not tried to remove the stain, so the sweater has not been washed or dry cleaned yet, worn only once.  Should I use Stain Solution plus Wool & Cashmere Shampoo?  ","Dear Renee-
Yes, you can use our Stain Solution and Wool & Cashmere Shampoo to wash your sweater. 

Pretreat any staining with our Stain Solution. Make sure to really work it into the fabric. If you choose to launder in the machine, turn the item inside out and place in a mesh bag. Add our Wool & Cashmere Shampoo directly into the drum or detergent dispenser. Make sure the machine is set to the Delicate or Woolen cycle. Most importantly, the water temperature must be cold/cold or risk shrinkage.

I have a cashmere sweater that is light grey and I've thought about dying it a different color.  Is this possible?  If so, how should I go about it?","Dear Melissa-
Have you ever tie dyed? The most common dye out there is RIT which is available in grocery stores, drugstores and craft stores. A company I bought dye from in college is dhamatrading.com.

For color choice, I recommend dying black. I don't know how the other colors will take or if you will get a ""heathered"" look dying with another color based on the original yarn dye structure.

After dying, wash the sweater alone because dye transfer will most likely occur. Also note in the dying process if it requires boiling or hot water which may shrink your sweater.

Fabric softener isn't necessary - it's merely a personal preference with regular laundry.  We do not recommend fabric softener for washing wool and cashmere, however.  

Our Whites Detergent doesn't contain bleach so it is perfectly safe to use with colored trims.

I recommend following our Wool & Cashmere reciple which I've listed below.If your dress has a lining however, you may have to follow different instructions.

Pretreat any stains with Stain Solution and gently work it into the fabric. Follow by hand washing in a bath of cool water and Wool & Cashmere Shampoo, turning the item inside out. Leave to soak for roughly 30 minutes and rinse well. Lay flat in its' natural shape to dry.

We like to steam our cashmere for a perfect finish and spray with Wool & Cashmere Spray between washing and wearing to keep the yarns fresh.

Are you noticing a problem while washing your sweaters with your well water or are you just concerned?

Best-
The Laundress","Dear Marilyn-
The delicate cycle or the lowest spin on your machine is what you want to aim for when washing cashmere. We recommend using a Mesh Washing Bag for delicate items which your husband's thick sweaters are not.

Washing is the best way to get ribbings back to shape. You can do the shortest washing cycle to get the job done.

Do you have a product that helps take the itch or scratchiness out of a new cashmere or wool sweater?  ","Hi Jean,
I recommend washing and soaking the scatchy items a few times and see if they soften up as there isn't much else you can do to soften the stiff hairs in the yarn.  You could use fabric softener, but it isn't great for the yarns because it puts a smooth coating on the item. If the itchiness is unbearable however, that is an option.

This sounds like a critter epidemic. If you can return the items, do so.

12/27/2013,Bonnie,"Dear Laundress-
I have a big moth problem. I have many cashmere and woolen sweaters many of which now have holes. I was told that I need to clean them in order to insure that the larva are gone. Dry cleaning would be hundreds of dollars. I was wondering if the Wool & Cashmere Shampoo would work and how do you use it.","Dear Bonnie-
The Wool & Cashmere Shampoo is certainly the correct product to use for cleaning such garments, however greater measures need to be taken before washing to ensure that the larva are in fact dead. Only under extreme temperatures do such bugs actually die. To effectively treat your clothing and storage spaces, please follow the steps listed below.
 
Tips for post moth attacks
·         Place infected clothing in airtight bags and freeze for 72 hours – the harsh temperatures will kill any lingering insects
·         Vacuum, dust and wash shelves and floors as moths feed on dust, dirt and body oils
·         Launder all clothing after freezing and cleaning is complete, in this case you should use Wool & Cashmere Shampoo – if you cannot launder at home, we recommend Slate NYC, a green dry cleaning/laundering service (see below for contact information)

·         Clean machine after washing infected items
·         Repair holes caused by moths immediately – we recommend Alter Knit for this job (see below for contact information)
 
Tips for moth prevention
·         Wash all garments at the beginning of a new season and before packing at the end of one
·         Clean drawers for the new season by washing, vacuuming and re-organizing them
·         Place Natural Lavender Sachets and Scented Drawer Sheets in Cedar in drawers and clothing storage units as cedar and lavender are natural moth and bug repellants
·         Spray clothing with the Wool & Cashmere Spray as cedar is a natural moth and bug repellant
·         Store clothing in breathable fabric such as cotton or linen that has a zipper such as the All-Purpose Storage Bag
·         Make sure to never store clothing in plastic or cardboard or in damp/humid areas

11/7/2011,Chad,"Dear Laundress-
What is the best way to remove mothball odor from cashmere?","Dear Chad-

Mothball odors can be very difficult to remove.  My best recommendation would be to make a bath with tepid water and white vinegar and allow your cashmere to soak for 30 minutes. Our Scented Vinegar works wonders for removing odors from fabrics.  

Rinse well, removing all vinegar. You can then make a bath with tepid water and our Wool & Cashmere Shampoo and leave to soak for 30 minutes.  

Lay flat to dry- do not use the dryer and steam while damp.  I have also linked below our recipe on Washing Wool & Cashmere.  In addition, lavender sachets are a more natural alternative to using mothballs; they are just as effective and smell much nicer.

Pilling is one of the downfalls to lovely cashmere.
Hand washing helps as well as machine washing with the item inside out. The pilling generally comes from movement of the body such as under the arms, however.

While we are firm believers in the Sweater Stone, the Sweater Comb would be the most apropriate de-pilling device for your fine cashmere.

I have a merino wool sweater that has a printed silk panel on the front. I have your J. Crew Cashmere Wash and your Delicate Wash and was wondering which one I should use to wash the garment. I am concerned about shrinkage and the integrity of the silk.  

Also, I have a wool blend skirt and a wool coat, would your Fabric Fresh be a good way to avoid dry cleaning these items? And could I wash them with the Wool & Cashmere Shampoo? They are both lined in acetate.  
","Dear Natasha-
For all three of your items, we recommend washing with the J.Crew Cashmere Wash. Our rule of thumb for blended fabric is to wash according to the highest percentage. i.e. if the item is 70% merino wool and 30% silk, wash with our Wool & Cashmere Shampoo, or J.Crew Cashmere Wash. This detergent is very gentle and will not harm the integrity of the silk paneling on your sweater. It will also work well to launder your wool blend skirt and wool coat!

Pretreat any staining with our Wash & Stain Bar. If you choose to launder in the machine instead of hand washing, place in a Mesh Bag. Add the J.Crew Cashmere Wash directly into the drum or detergent dispenser. Make sure the machine is set to the Delicate or Woolen cycle.
